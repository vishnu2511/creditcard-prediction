# creditcard-prediction
Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository comprising of 25 attributes and 30000 instances have been employed to analyse the performance of algorithms. Moreover, the effect of feature selection has also been identified with respect to each classification algorithm. From the  dataset  I’ve  predicted  whether  the  applicant   will   pay  credit card amount  In    classification  method, I  have  taken  Logistic  Regression, Support  vector  Machine, Decision  Tree  Classifier  and  Naïve Bayes Classifier. By using all these models we need to select which model works better for the prediction.
